## Project Organization

The project structure when using all features is as follows:

    ├── data               <- Folder for storing your data
    ├── docs               <- A default Sphinx project; see sphinx-doc.org for details
    ├── models             <- Trained and serialized models, model predictions, or model summaries
    ├── results            <- Folder for saving results
    |
    ├── src                <- Source code for use in this project
    │   ├── data           <- Scripts to download or generate data
    │   ├── features       <- Scripts to turn raw data into features for modeling
    │   ├── models         <- Scripts to train models and then use trained models to make
    │   │                     predictions
    │   ├── utils          <- This folder is for storing all utility functions, such as auth,
    |   |                     theme, handleApiError, etc.
    │   ├── visualization  <- Scripts to create visualizations
    │
    ├── venv                        <- Folder containing all needed files for teh virtual environment
    ├── .env                        <- File for storing passwords
    ├── .gitignore                  <- Specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore
    ├── .pre-commit.config.yaml     <- Configuration file for the pre-commits
    ├── poetry.lock                 <- Autogenerated file for handling dependencies
    ├── pyproject.toml              <- Configuration of dependencies and project variables e.g. version
    └── README.md                   <- The top-level README for developers using this project.

## Results

### Gradient Boosting

<img src="./results/nomalized_confusion_matrix/gradient_boosting.png" alt="Normalized confusion matrix Gradient Boosting" width=500 height=400>

- "No Failure" is classified completely correctly
- "Heat Failure", "Overstrain Failure" & "Power Failure" are reliably classified
- Random Failure" and "Tool wear Failure" are practically not recognised at all

### Random Forest

<img src="./results/nomalized_confusion_matrix/random_forest.png" alt="Normalized confusion matrix Random Forest" width=500 height=400>

- "No Failure" is classified completely correctly
- "Heat Failure" and "Power Failure" are recognised very well
- "Overstrain Failure" recognised significantly worse than with the gradient boosting classifier
- "Random Failure" and "Tool wear Failure" are practically not recognised at all

### Neural Network

<img src="./results/nomalized_confusion_matrix/neural_net.png" alt="Normalized confusion matrix Neural Network" width=500 height=400>

- "No Failure" and "Overstrain Failure " are classified completely correctly
- Performance of "Heat Failure" has dropped significantly
- "Random Failure" and "Tool wear Failure" are practically not recognised at all

### Comparison

| Model                         | Weighted F1 Score  |
|-------------------------------|--------------------|
| Naive Estimator               | 0.9515             |
| Gradient Boosting Classifier  | **0.9822**         |
| Random Forest Classifier      | 0.9785             |
| Neural Network                | 0.9764             |

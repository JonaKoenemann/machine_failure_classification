# Machine failure classification

Version: 0.1.0

Multi classification for automated detection of faults in a production machine.

This project is based on the [python template](https://github.com/JonaKoenemann/python_template) of       [JonaKonemann](https://github.com/JonaKoenemann).

# Project Organization

The project structure when using all features is as follows:

    ├── data               <- Folder for storing your data 
    ├── docs               <- A default Sphinx project; see sphinx-doc.org for details
    ├── models             <- Trained and serialized models, model predictions, or model summaries
    ├── notebooks          <- Jupyter notebooks
    |
    ├── src                <- Source code for use in this project
    │   ├── data           <- Scripts to download or generate data
    │   ├── features       <- Scripts to turn raw data into features for modeling
    │   ├── models         <- Scripts to train models and then use trained models to make
    │   │                     predictions
    │   ├── utils          <- This folder is for storing all utility functions, such as auth, 
    |   |                     theme, handleApiError, etc.
    │   ├── visualization  <- Scripts to create visualizations 
    │
    ├── venv                        <- Folder containing all needed files for teh virtual environment
    ├── .env                        <- File for storing passwords
    ├── .gitignore                  <- Specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore
    ├── .pre-commit.config.yaml     <- Configuration file for the pre-commits
    ├── poetry.lock                 <- Autogenerated file for handling dependencies
    ├── pyproject.toml              <- Configuration of dependencies and project variables e.g. version
